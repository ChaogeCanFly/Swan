*"It is not enough for code to work."
― Robert C. Martin*

_Swan_ is a Topology Optimization software developed in Matlab. Currently, it supports the resolution of 2D and 3D topology optimization problems with density or level-set as design variables.
Swan aims to offer an adaptable framework that allows to implement new optimization techniques or functionalities fastly, thanks to its modular design.

## Current features ##
Swan currently supports the resolution of **macro** and **micro**\* scale problems  defined in terms of the following design variables:
- Density
- Level Set

<sub>*Note: 3D micro scale problems are not available yet. </sub>

Intermediate material properties are determined by the following implemented interpolation schemes:
- SIMP
- SIMP-ALL



Swan's modular design allows to combine several functions to define different optimization problems. Each function can be used as a cost or a constraint in the optimization problem.  The functions that are currently implemented are:
- Compliance
- Volume
- Perimeter
- Non-self adjoint compliance (used to minimize/maximize displacements)
- Homogenized elasticity matrix (used in micro scale problems)

In terms of optimization techniques the following optimizers are implemented:
 - Density: Projected Gradient, MMA and IPOPT. 
 - Level-set: SLERP, Projected SLERP and Hamilton-Jacobi
